                <p> Two moths expeience with web development. I always loved to design websites 
                    and building it. I have always seen this as my passion writing different codes and
                    make responsive websites. I am not only a web developer, but also web designer as well.
                    The reason why i do both is because i have a knowledge with graphic designs from before.

                <p>Three years experience with Photoshop. I have always been working on projects
                    such as Logos, Banners, Wallpapers, Rebrands, Gaming graphics, Revamps and a lot
                    more. I have also been using other programms such as Cinema4D to developer
                    3D graphic designs. But right now i use Photoshop for designing 2D elements and 
                    making other effects into it.
